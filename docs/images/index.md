    Learn the difference between terminals and shells. Understand how commands are interpreted and executed, and get used to navigating your system through text.

-   :lucide-folder-open:{ .lg .middle } [__Filesystems__](workshop/02-filesystems/index.md)

    ---

    Everything on your computer lives somewhere. Learn how Unix-like systems organize files and directories, and navigate the filesystem with confidence.

-   :lucide-lock:{ .lg .middle } [__Permissions__](workshop/03-permissions/index.md)

    Not everyone should have access to everything. Learn how Unix permission systems work and how to control who can read, write, and execute your files.

-   :lucide-play:{ .lg .middle } [__Programs__](workshop/04-programs/index.md)

    ---

    The command line is only as powerful as the programs you run on it. Learn how to execute programs, manage processes, and understand what happens when you run a command.

-   :lucide-workflow:{ .lg .middle } [__Input / Output__](workshop/05-input-output/index.md)

    ---

    The real power of the command line comes from connecting programs together. Learn how stdin, stdout, and stderr work, and chain commands with pipes and redirection.

    ---

    No developer works from scratch. Learn how package managers like APT, Homebrew, and Webi work, and how to set up a development environment that works for you.

-   :lucide-file-code:{ .lg .middle } [__Shell Scripting__](workshop/07-shell-scripting/index.md)

    ---

    Stop repeating yourself. Write shell scripts that automate repetitive tasks and put your command line skills to work — variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.

-   :lucide-file-pen:{ .lg .middle } [__Terminal Text Editors__](workshop/08-text-editors/index.md)

    ---

    Before you can write scripts or configure your system, you need to edit files. Learn the essentials of Nano and Vim — open, edit, save, and quit without getting stuck.
