# Shell & CLI Fundamentals

**The terminal can be overwhelming and it is difficult to know where to start. Sometimes all it takes is a guide to walk you through the basics to go further and learn things yourself. This course framework aims to teach you shells, filesystems, and Unix tools that developers use every day. Once you learn how this system works harmoniously, you will always wonder how you lived without them.**
